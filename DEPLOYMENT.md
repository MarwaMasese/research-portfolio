# Netlify Deployment Guide

## What was fixed:

1. **Removed GitHub Pages configuration**: Removed `basePath` and `assetPrefix` from `next.config.ts` since these are not needed for Netlify
2. **Fixed Netlify publish directory**: Changed from `.next` to `out` in `netlify.toml` 
3. **Fixed redirects**: Updated redirects to properly handle client-side routing
4. **Added _redirects file**: Backup redirect configuration for Netlify
5. **Updated metadata**: Removed hardcoded GitHub Pages URL from layout metadata

## Deployment Steps:

1. **Push your changes** to your GitHub repository
2. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - Go to https://netlify.com
   - Click "Add new site" > "Import an existing project"
   - Connect your GitHub account and select your repository
3. **Build settings** (should be automatically detected):
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `out`
   - Node version: `18` (from netlify.toml)

## Local testing:

To test locally before deploying:
```bash
npm run build
# Check that the 'out' directory is created with all files
```

## If you still have issues:

1. **Clear build cache**: Delete `.next` and `out` directories, then rebuild
2. **Check Netlify logs**: Look at the deploy logs in your Netlify dashboard
3. **Verify file paths**: Ensure all your imports and asset paths are correct

Your styling should now load correctly on Netlify! ðŸŽ‰
